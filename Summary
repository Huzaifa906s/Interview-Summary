SUMMARY

Problem Description:
In OpenTelemetry Collector version 7.8.0, the filelog receiver continuously logs errors when it encounters an empty log file in the monitored directory. This behavior was not observed in version 7.7.0.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure the filelog receiver with a standard configuration.
2. Place an empty file (e.g., consul-2.log) in the monitored directory.
3. Start the OpenTelemetry Collector service.

Expected Behavior:
Errors should not be logged for empty log files.

Actual Behavior:
Errors are logged continuously when an empty log file is detected in the monitored directory.

Addressing the Problem

1. Root Cause:
The issue likely originates from a regression in version 7.8.0 of the OpenTelemetry Collector, where the filelog receiver does not handle empty files properly. It might attempt to read data from empty files, causing errors to be generated repeatedly.

2. Impact:
Log Noise: Unnecessary error messages can obscure critical issues in the logs.
Performance Overhead: Continuous logging of errors may increase resource consumption (e.g., CPU and disk usage).
Monitoring Inefficiency: Affected systems may produce misleading insights due to irrelevant error logs.

3. How to Fix the Issue:
Short-Term Workarounds
Remove Empty Files
Use a script to clean up empty files from the monitored directory before starting the Collector
Ignore Empty Files (if configurable):
Adjust the filelog receiver configuration to exclude empty files (if the feature exists in the latest documentation or source code).
